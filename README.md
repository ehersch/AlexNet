# AlexNet

Reimplementing AlexNet in C++ (on smaller benchmark)

## Learning Experience for using LibTorch

(Python's PyTorch C++ API)

## Evaluation

Will probably use ImageNet-1k and download model weights from Hugging Face

Some other more specific things I want to see:

- Memory of model in C++ vs Python (advantage?)
- FLOPS/sec or time per forward pass for C++ vs Python

## Objectives

General C++ comfortability and ability to use deep learning packages (like Torch) in C++.
